                        ClassHealth may require the User to pay with a credit
                        card, wire transfer, debit card or cheque for Services
                        for which subscription amount(s) is/are payable.
                        ClassHealth will collect such User's credit card number
                        and/or other financial institution information such as
                        bank account numbers and will use that information for
                        the billing and payment processes, including but not
                        limited to the use and disclosure of such credit card
                        number and information to third parties as necessary to
                        complete such billing operation. Verification of credit
                        information, however, is accomplished solely by the User
                        through the authentication process. User's
                        credit-card/debit card details are transacted upon
                        secure sites of approved payment gateways which are
                        digitally under encryption, thereby providing the
                        highest possible degree of care as per current
                        technology. However, ClassHealth provides you an option
                        not to save your payment details. User is advised,
                        however, that internet technology is not full proof safe
                        and User should exercise discretion on using the same.

                        Due to the communications standards on the Internet,
                        when a User or the End-User or anyone who visits the
                        Website, ClassHealth automatically receives the URL of
                        the site from which anyone visits. ClassHealth also
                        receives the Internet Protocol (IP) address of each

                        access the World Wide Web), User's computer operating
                        system and type of web browser the User is using, email
                        patterns, as well as the name of User's ISP. This
                        information is used to analyze overall trends to help
                        ClassHealth improve its Service. The linkage between
                        User's IP address and User's personally identifiable
                        information is not shared with or disclosed to third
                        parties. Notwithstanding the above, ClassHealth may
                        share and/or disclose some of the aggregate findings
                        (not the specific data) in anonymized form (i.e.,
                        non-personally identifiable) with advertisers, sponsors,
                        investors, strategic partners, and others in order to

                      online services and software manufacturers to help provide
                      a child-friendly online environment. These tools also can
                      prevent minors from disclosing their name, address, and
